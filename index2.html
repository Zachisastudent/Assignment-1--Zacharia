              <p>I stepped out of my comfort zone of interact with people i have never met before as i had to provide quality service.
                This also benefits my presentation as i am more confident and
                comfortable speaking to others.</p>

              new space and interests me a lot. Play to earn games have been really popular as people need blockchain technology allows people
              earn while spending time playing their game, this is an interesting concept of the metaverse will be the future of gaming.

            <p>I believe that the saying "health is wealth" is very true and if you are not physically and mentally healthy, it comes with a price. Therefore
              i always push myself beyond my boundaries in the gym and my sport (dragonboat). I go to gym about 5-6 times and i look forward to every session.
              In the future i hope to be a Physical Trainer as i would like to help others in finding their purpose and help them to become a better version of themselves.
